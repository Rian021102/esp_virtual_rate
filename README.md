# Rate Prediction by Leveraging Machine Learning Using ESP Parameter Data 

## Introduction

This project showcases the machine learning capability to predict rates using Electric Submersible Pump Parameter Data. The data utilized originates from a Hackathon within the Oil and Gas industry, aiming to integrate data and machine learning into the sector. However, the available data per well is insufficient for time series forecasting. Therefore, this project is currently limited to rate prediction only. It's a work in progress and will be updated regularly.
